ww# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Assignment 2

The goal of this assignment (which will be marked!) is to practice webscraping in R. You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom.  This will occur _automatically_ on the due date, so there is no (separate) procedure for "submitting" the assignment.  Just **make sure that you have pushed your locally changed repository to the remote on GitHub**!  You can do this as many times as you wish.

Remember that we will evaluate you based on your compiled RMarkdown file (in `.html` format). Your responses should be in a written format and in bold.  They should be placed directly under the questions, so that it's easier for us to read and find them. The question should be followed by code that you used to arrive at that answer. Use the code to show your work, thinking, and progress!

Submissions that do not compile and contain an `.html` file will receive a penalty of 20 points.



**Deadline:** October 31, 2020, 14:00 (London time).

#### Rmarkdown guide:

  - __do not__ print out the whole dataset in your knitted document (it is fine to show how the data look like with `head()`)
  - __load all libraries in the beginning__ of your document and use `suppressMessages()` to hide all the messages it produces
  - __readability__ of your code is important for collaboration with others â€” please read through this guide to `R` code style: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
  - present only what is __necessary__, but make sure that it __answers the question__
